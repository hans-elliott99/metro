# metro
## Fast data metrics from the command-line.

`metro` is under development and is an educational project.

Working as a research assistant, I've come face to face with enormous amounts 
of data stored in delimeted text files. I often interact with these files 
through a command-line interface, so before pulling them into Python or R I've
found that shell commands, such as GNU's `head`, `wc -l`, `sort`, or `uniq` 
can be very useful for getting to understand what actually lives in any given 
text file.  
My goal is for `metro` to formalize this process and add some new features
while remaining fast and simple, like GNU's classic commands.
